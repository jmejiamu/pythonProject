This is an app that I have been working for about seven moth maybe less.
This app is about helping student who are learning English (basics). It is pretty simple users enter the base form of any irregular verb and it output the three forms of the verbs.
For Example:
</br>
Input</br>
Irregular verb: do </br>
Output would be </br>
Base form: do </br>
Simple past: did </br>
Past participle: done </br>
